Content Studio allows you to organize your content in multiple independent repositories.

Content Projects also offer individual access control and permissions, as well as other settings to toggle features and language(s) for the project.

Privileged users can manage projects via <<settings#, Content Studio settings>>.

== Project context

The project context is always visible in the Content Studio header. If you have access to multiple projects, you can easily swich to a different project in the context selector:
Project context can be switched at any time by using project selector in the Content Studio header:
