This section describes how to configure Content Studio via the config file.

The file should be called `com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg` and placed into the `$XP_HOME/config` folder of your XP installation.

=== Html Editor XSS

Content Studio's Rich Editor automatically removes any `<script>` and `<iframe>` tags from the source code.
This measurement effectively reduces potential for XSS injections.
This also removes any scripts from documents migrated from XP 6 on first save.

Iframes can still be added through the use of the built-in `embed` https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/macros#built_in_macros[macro].

You can allow `<script>` tag in html fields at your own risk by adding the following to the config file:

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
htmlinput.allowScripts = true
----
