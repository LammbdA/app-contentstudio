== 3.0.0

=== Content Projects

*Content Projects* allow separating content into several independent repositories (for example thematically, by country etc.).
Each project can have its own default language and roles, and be set up as Public, Private or with custom read permissions.
Initially there is just one default project, but you can create and manage new projects in the new Settings section
(accessible via new top-level menu on the left-hand side).

If current user has permissions for several projects, he/she will be asked to select one of them when opening Content Studio.
User always works in the context of a project. <<issues#,Issues>> have also become context-dependent, which means that issues are accessible
only inside the project they were created in.

Read more about Content Projects in the <<projects#,dedicated section>>.

XP 7.3.0 offers https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/api/lib-project[new API] for managing Content Projects.


=== Version Comparison

With the new Version Comparison dialog it's now possible to compare two versions of the same content side by side.
The dialog can be accessed from the <<widgets#version_history,Version History widget>>. You can revert to any
version of the content directly from the same dialog.

=== Light skin

As the first step to support of custom skins, *Content Studio 3.0* introduces `light` skin for the
header and other visual elements.

* New style of highlighting invalid controls upon form validation
